# Wind_Energy_Proposal_Group12
This repository has the mathematical modeling and data analysis for a renewable energy solution in Inuvik. Our project focuses on wind technology to support a community development of 1,000 people. We utilize calculus (integrals) to characterize the energy resource and differential equations (ODEs) to model a Battery Energy Storage System (BESS).

Phase 1: Completed the solar, geothermal, and wind energy branches. Characterized the resource using historical weather/flow data and numerical integration (trapezoid rule) to determine annual energy yields.

Phase 2: Developed a realistic demand profile for an Arctic community and modeled a storage system using an ODE solver to test grid reliability and "blackout" scenarios.
