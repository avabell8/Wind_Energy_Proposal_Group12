# Wind_Energy_Proposal_Group12
This repository has the mathematical modeling and data analysis for a renewable energy solution in Inuvik. Our project focuses on wind technology to support a community development of 1,000 people. We utilize calculus (integrals) to characterize the energy resource and differential equations (ODEs) to model a Battery Energy Storage System (BESS).
